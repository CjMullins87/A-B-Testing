# Exploring Hypothesis Testing Using the Northwind Database



### Overview

To wrap up Module 3 of Flatiron's online data science curriculum, we will use an abbreviated version of the Northwind SQL database and conduct queries to access data and use tools such as scipy to analyze this data and perform basic A-B testing. Conducting these tests will give us an opportunity to 1) recognize/implement good experimental design, 2) recognize and react to non-normal distributions of data, and 3) effectively select and implement tests that fit the data available.

### Hypotheses We Will Be Testing

>**1. Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?**
>
>**2. Does offering a discount impact the total value of a sale? aka, is it successfully encouraging customers to purchase more?**
>
>**3. Are there some employees performing better than others? If so, we can use this insight to coach other employees.**
>
>**4. Is there a manager whose team is outperforming the other? This might influence pay raise of a manager, and help us coach develop the other team.**
